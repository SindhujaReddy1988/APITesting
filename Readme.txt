I have read data from API end point given but faced an issue.

Issue:
=> weather.com is giving only sigle set of temperature details for entire city ex: chicago, where as the API data read is giving details for each neighborhood because of which there were no common properties to compare. Hence, i have processed the JSON string read and compared values statically.

NOTE:

I have maximum tried to use java and plain selenium rather than using any API testing tools/frameworks available, because sett up is quite time consuming.
